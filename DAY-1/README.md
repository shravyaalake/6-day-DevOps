# Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to DevOps & AWS Account Setup

## üìù Summary

On Day 1 of DevOps training, we were introduced to the core concepts of DevOps through a presentation session. We also created and set up our own AWS accounts to prepare for hands-on cloud computing practices in the upcoming days.

## üìò What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a combination of **Development** and **Operations**. It is a set of practices that aims to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, allowing them to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

### ‚ú® Key Principles of DevOps

- **Collaboration:** Improved communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Automation:** Streamlining processes such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.
- **Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Ensuring fast and reliable delivery of software.
- **Monitoring & Feedback:** Actively monitoring performance and incorporating feedback for continuous improvement.

## üîÑ DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle consists of several stages that work in a continuous loop:

1. **Plan** ‚Äì Define business requirements and plan the features
2. **Develop** ‚Äì Write and manage code using version control systems
3. **Build** ‚Äì Compile code and run automated tests
4. **Test** ‚Äì Perform quality assurance and testing
5. **Release** ‚Äì Deploy the application to staging or production
6. **Deploy** ‚Äì Continuous deployment or delivery to live environment
7. **Operate** ‚Äì Monitor and maintain infrastructure
8. **Monitor** ‚Äì Collect performance metrics and user feedback

These stages support **continuous development**, **integration**, **testing**, **deployment**, and **monitoring**.

## üé• Teaching Mode

The above topics were explained in **presentation mode** using slides and visual diagrams for better conceptual understanding.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Account Creation

We also created our individual AWS accounts to start working on cloud services. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud platform used in DevOps practices.

## üîß Steps to Create an AWS Account

1. **Go to the AWS website**  
   Visit [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on the **"Create an AWS Account"** button.

2. **Enter account details**
   - Email address
   - Account name (this will be your AWS account alias)

3. **Set up root user password**

4. **Contact information**
   - Choose between a personal or business account
   - Provide phone number and address

5. **Payment information**
   - Add a valid credit/debit card for billing (AWS offers a free tier, but some services might incur charges)

6. **Identity verification**
   - Confirm using a verification code sent to your phone

7. **Select a support plan**
   - For training purposes, the **Basic (Free)** plan is recommended

8. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**
   - Once the setup is complete, log in as the root user using the credentials you created

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- Understood the foundational concepts of DevOps and its lifecycle.
- Created an AWS account and accessed the AWS Console for upcoming cloud-based tasks.
